                This project started out as a group project in my bootcamp. The goal was to understand what factors drive user approval and engagement. 
                The original dataset used was the IMDb Extensive Dataset published on <a href = https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset >Kaggle</a>. This 
                dataset is an especially powerful tool for understanding movies, as it contains 85,855 movies, spanning the entire history of movie making. 
                In order to make a dataset useable for this purpose we manipulated and cleaned the data, deriving a single .csv. The main metric we used for user approval
                was mean user score, and the main metric for user engagement was total votes. A couple of our findings will be helpful to understand as a starting point for the
                present work. The first finding is that there are fewer early movies that get low scores, than there are later movies that get low scores. Second, we found that 
                in movies with only one genre designation, the average user approval for a movie is significantly different based on what that genre is. Finally, we found that 
                the median number of votes a movie in IMDb will get is low (my estimate in the present work is 484 votes) but that a substantial population of outliers exist, 
                which generate significantly more engegement - from thousands to millions of votes.

            <h3 class = 'text-center'>But Can These Data Help Us Predict Engagement or Approval?</h3>
            <p>
            The initial analysis on the IMDb dataset was interesting, but falls somewhat short of the original goal - the idea was to identify the factors that
            lead to user approval and engagement. In order to fullfill the original goal of the project, I decided to pick up where my group and I left off, and 
            further transform and analyze the data from the IMDb extensive dataset. My new goal was to attempt to use some of the data in the data set to engineer features
            which could be used to model the data using machine learning algorythms.  
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3 class = 'text-center'>Reexploration and Feature Engineering</h3>
            <p>
            The main issue that I saw initially with respect to the implementation of a machine learning model, was the fact that a lot of the data in this set is categorical.
            There were three categories that interested me for this part of the project - genre, language and country. All of these columns could consist of one or several string
            values. For example, a genre entry in this data set may contain 1 - 3 genre values, out of a set of 23 unique genre values. This kind of data is not ready for an ML model
            and needs to be dummy encoded in some way. I used the genre column to engineer 24 features for my analysis - one for each genre, plus a feature called genre complexity.
            Genre complexity is a count of the number of genre designations a movie has in it's genre column. To code this I used a for loop to loop through the genre column,
            split each entry into a list and then append the length of a list to an empty list for genre complexity. The genre features were processed similarly. In this case, 
            I looped through a list of genres and for each, I looped through the genre column. I again split each value into a list, and then used an if statement to look for 
            whatever value of genre the first loop was on. In each case a zero was added to my list for each genre, but if the loop found the genre while looking for it, this 
            would be changed to a 1. This way every movie in the set has a vector of length 23 for its genre classification, and a 1 in any position of the genre vector indicates
            that a particular genre is present.  
            </p>

            <br><br>
            <p>
            I decided not to do a full encoding of country and language fields, due to the large number of values these can take. Instead, I tried to anticipate countries and 
            languages that would be strongly represented within the data, and specifically encoded these into binary features. For example I have a feature to cover whether 
            English is present in my model, but I did not do this for every language. I used a list of the 
            <a href = https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/production-countries/#tab=territory>top countries for movie production</a>, to aid in my decision making.

            <br>
            <p>
            In order to decide which of these features I should use, I made a lot of box plots to see if the medians were different for the films with a particular country or
            language, versus the ones without.

            <h3 class = 'text-center'>Modeling The Data With ML Methods</h3>
            <p>
            The first step toward modeling the data with machine learning is to decide what kind of algorythm to apply to the data. I'm skeptical of regression models
            for this problem, because it seems overly ambitious for what I'm trying to do. Instead I decided to view this as a classification problem. In order to apply 
            a classification strategy I encoded two new columns (one in each of two datasets). The first, for average vote is called is_liked and has a value of 1 if the 
            movie has an average score greater than 6. Six is a reasonable value to use, because it is pretty close to the mean value for average score. The analogous column 
            for total votes, is is_outlier, which gets a value of 1 if the total number of votes the movie has is greater than 1.5*IQR + the median number of votes 
            (i.e. roughly 2250 votes).  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            I prioritiezed decision tree and random forest models, as these are relatively easily understood, and I know of ways to extract feature importances for them. Both 
            of these models work by separating populations based on variables. A decision tree uses features to make splits in the data, starting with an inital split (the root node)
            and then through successive layers of nodes, with the goal of purifying two output conditions in the end nodes. The method uses gini impurity as a metric for how good a split is - 
            a gini of 0 would perfectly separate the conditions, where a split with a gini value of 0.5 is useless and separates the population such that half the members of the resultant nodes
            are in one classification, and half are in the other. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Random forest is effectively the same thing as decision tree, but it has additional features that optimize the tree model. A random forest model constructs some number of 
            decision tree models, and then uses them to form an optimized tree. 
            </p>
            <h3 class = 'text-center'>Implementing and Tuning the Models</h3>
           
            <p>
            All the machine learning tools used in this work were imported from the Scikit-learn library of Python. In order to implement models, the data first needed to be processed.
            A first processing step was to use the min/max scaler to scale the features, because year and duration had much different ranges than most of the other features. Two different
            datasets were used in the implementation - the set used to predict is_liked contained 38 features, while the one used for is_outlier contained 40. Some features, such as 
            genre_complexity showed promise for the engagement prediction, but not the approval prediction, which is the reason for the different number. I optimized these models by 
            tuning the hyperparameters iteratively over a range that seemed reasonable. In particular, the tree depth parameter seemed important. Given an arbitrary tree depth, the 
            models could almost completely sort the training data, but comparisons with the test data showed this to be overfitting.

            <br>
            <p>
            The best results I was able to obtain for audience approval came from random forest models. The random forest model with a tree depth of 16 and the default
            100 estimator trees gave an accuracy of 0.709 on the testing set. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            The best results I was able to obtain for audience engagement were better, and came from a simple decision tree model. The random forest models gave only modest
            improvements in the audiece approval data, and also significantly complicated the model for audience engagement. The best decision tree for engagement had a tree depth of 8, and 
            gave an accuracy of 0.808. More detailed results follow in the form of classification report tables.

                <p>In my view the most interesting results came from the engagement model. The model was able to sort outliers from normal (e.g. very low) engagement 
                    with around 80% accuracy, but the classification report supplies some nuances that show this is a somewhat misleading picture. In the report above,
                    recall refers to the proportion of a classification identified by the algorythm, and precision tells us how often the algorythm made a correct 
                    identification within a class. What we see is that the algorythm is very good at identifying normal engagement - it sorts 94% of those movies into the
                    correct class. On the other hand it's sorting a significant number of the outliers into the normal class. This fact is most likely due to the fact that the
                    dataset is imbalanced with respect to these two populations. The set contains many more ordinary movies than outliers (by definition). Its possible that the
                    results could be improved by attempting to address this imbalance. 
                
                </p>
                <div class = 'text-center'>

                <p>
                 The engagement model made use of relatively few of the features.    
                </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                   The engagement model is relatively striking, because of it's simplicity. Looking above, we find that the year, duration, presence of english language, and 
                   genre complexity dwarf the other freatures. It is somewhat surprising that genre categories are not very prominent in their use here.  
                </p>
                <h3 class = 'text-center'>Discussion: Approval</h3>
                
                <p> 
               Approval is more straightforward to interpret because the dataset is not imbalanced with respect to approval. The threshold for the two categories was set at 6 because 
               that value is close to the central tendancies revealed in the first figure for approval. The classification report shows that this model is equally precise for both classes
               , but it tends to miss fewer of the cases where the film is approved of. At about 70% accuracy, this model is not without merit, but not highly predictive. 
                </p>
                <div class = 'text-center'>
                <img src = "figures/fi_approval.png">
                <p>
                 The approval model was a random forest, and slightly more complex.    
                </p>
                </div>
                <p> 
                Our model for approval is somewhat more multifaceted than the one for engagement. It is much more surprising to me that the genre categories are marginal
                in this model, as the medians for these genres often differ markedly. A possible reason for this may be that the number of movies in some of the genres is 
                small relative to the overall dataset. Horror and Drama have very different median values for approval, and are relatively large genres, so it is not surprising
                to find that they are the most used genres for splitting the tree.
